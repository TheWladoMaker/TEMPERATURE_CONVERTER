Temperature Conversion Program v0.2

Overview

This Python script provides a simple command-line interface for converting temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. 
It now supports converting multiple temperatures at once.

Changes in v0.2

*The program now accepts multiple temperature values at once. 
You can enter multiple values separated by spaces, and the program will convert each one.

*Improved input validation. 
The program now checks that the user's input is either 'Celsius' or 'Fahrenheit' before proceeding.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Time module (standard library)

Usage
The script will prompt you to enter the type of data you want to convert (Celsius or Fahrenheit), 
and then the temperature values you want to convert. You can enter multiple values separated by spaces.

After the conversion, the script will ask if you want to convert another data point. 
If you answer 'yes', the process repeats. If you answer 'no', the script will exit.

Functions

The script contains the following functions:

*fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit): Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
*celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius): Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
*points(): Simulates a loading time by printing a series of points with a delay.

Error Handling

The script includes error handling to catch invalid inputs. 
If the user enters anything other than 'Celsius' or 'Fahrenheit' when asked what type of data they want to convert, 
or if they enter anything other than a number when asked for a temperature, 
the script will print an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid input.

Temperature Converter

This project is a simple program written in Python that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

How to Use

The program asks the user to enter a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
It will then convert the entered temperature to the other unit.
